# ─── SteamPipe deploy scripts ───────────────────────────────────────
# Generates the SteamPipe build scripts (app/depot VDF) and
# steam_appid.txt from the .in templates next to this file into
# ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/steam/. Enabled per preset via CT_STEAMPIPE=ON
# (see cmake/presets/steam.json).
#
# Everything derivable comes from the root project() call — the VDF
# "desc" tracks PROJECT_VERSION on every configure. Only the Steam IDs
# are cache variables; the defaults are Valve's Spacewar test app.
# Override for a real game on the command line or in a preset:
#   -DCT_STEAM_APP_ID=123456 -DCT_STEAM_DEPOT_ID_WINDOWS=123457 ...
#
# The app manifest's depot keys and each depot script's DepotID come
# from the SAME variable — the two cannot drift apart.
#
# Static MinGW runtime (no shipped libc++.dll / libunwind.dll) is a
# one-line target_link_options genex in each depot executable — see
# src/*/CMakeLists.txt and tests/CMakeLists.txt. Per-target on purpose:
# no helper function, no global flags, no toolchain policy.
